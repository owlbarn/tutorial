# Algorithmic Differentiation

TBD

## Introduction

Computing derivatives (differentiation) is crucial in many scientific related fields:
find maximum or minimum values using gradient descent (see later chapter);
ODE (see later chapter);
Non-linear optimisation such as KKT optimality conditions is still a prime application.

One new crucial application is in machine learning.

### Chain Rule

Before diving into how to do differentiation on computers, let's recall how to do it manually from our Calculus 101.

Liang: *you need to talk about derivative, gradient, hessian, etc.*

Explain the Chain rule

Example 

### Differentiation Methods 

As the models and algorithms become increasingly complex, sometimes the function being implicit, it is impractical to perform manual differentiation.
Therefore, we turn to computer-based automated computation methods. 
There are three: numerical differentiation, symbolic differentiation, and algorithmic differentiation.

**Numerical Differentiation**

Simple intro; see later chapter

**Symbolic Differentiation**

Example

**Algorithmic Differentiation**

Algorithmic differentiation (AD) is also known as automatic differentiation. 
It is a powerful tool in many fields.

It's advantage compared with the other two.

Now let's talk about AD.

## How Algorithmic Differentiation Works

REFER: *Evaluating Derivatives*, Chapter 3.

### Theoretical Basis

Tangent, Adjoint, first derivative, higher derivative, etc.

### Forward Modes

### Reverse Modes

## Forward or Reverse?

Since both can be used to differentiate a function then the natural question is which mode we should choose in practice. The short answer is: it depends on your function.

In general, given a function that you want to differentiate, the rule of thumb is:

* if input variables >> output variables, then use backward mode;
* if input variables << output variables, then use forward mode.

Later we will show example of this point.


## High-level APIs

The design of AD in Owl.

Owl provides both numerical differentiation (in [Numdiff.Generic](https://github.com/ryanrhymes/owl/blob/ppl/src/base/optimise/owl_numdiff_generic.mli) module) and algorithmic differentiation (in [Algodiff.Generic](https://github.com/ryanrhymes/owl/blob/ppl/src/base/optimise/owl_algodiff_generic.mli) module).

`Algodiff.Generic` is a functor which is able to support both `float32` and `float64` precision `AD`. However, you do not need to deal with `Algodiff.Generic.Make` directly since there are already two ready-made modules.

- `Algodiff.S` supports `float32` precision;
- `Algodiff.D` supports `float64` precision;

`Algodiff` has implemented both forward and backward mode of AD. The complete list of APIs can be found in [owl_algodiff_generic.mli](https://github.com/ryanrhymes/owl/blob/ppl/src/base/optimise/owl_algodiff_generic.mli). The core APIs are listed below.

```text

  val diff : (t -> t) -> t -> t
  (* calculate derivative for f : scalar -> scalar *)

  val grad : (t -> t) -> t -> t
  (* calculate gradient for f : vector -> scalar *)

  val jacobian : (t -> t) -> t -> t
  (* calculate jacobian for f : vector -> vector *)

  val hessian : (t -> t) -> t -> t
  (* calculate hessian for f : scalar -> scalar *)

  val laplacian : (t -> t) -> t -> t
  (* calculate laplacian for f : scalar -> scalar *)

```

Besides, there are also more helper functions such as `jacobianv` for calculating jacobian vector product; `diff'` for calculating both `f x` and `diff f x`, and etc.

## Examples

Mastering AD requires practice. Let's see some examples.

### Higher-Order Derivatives

The following code first defines a function `f0`, then calculates from the first to the fourth derivative by calling `Algodiff.AD.diff` function.

```ocaml env=algodiff_00
open Algodiff.D;;

let map f x = Owl.Mat.map (fun a -> a |> pack_flt |> f |> unpack_flt) x;;

(* calculate derivatives of f0 *)
let f0 x = Maths.(tanh x);;
let f1 = diff f0;;
let f2 = diff f1;;
let f3 = diff f2;;
let f4 = diff f3;;

let x = Owl.Mat.linspace (-4.) 4. 200;;
let y0 = map f0 x;;
let y1 = map f1 x;;
let y2 = map f2 x;;
let y3 = map f3 x;;
let y4 = map f4 x;;

(* plot the values of all functions *)
let h = Plot.create "plot_00.png" in
Plot.plot ~h x y0;
Plot.plot ~h x y1;
Plot.plot ~h x y2;
Plot.plot ~h x y3;
Plot.plot ~h x y4;
Plot.output h;;
```

Start your `utop`, then load and open `Owl` library. Copy and past the code above, the generated figure will look like this.

![Higher order derivatives](images/algodiff/plot_00.png "plot 00"){ width=90% #fig:algodiff:plot00 }

If you replace `f0` in the previous example with the following definition, then you will have another good-looking figure :)

```ocaml env=algodiff_00
let f0 x = Maths.(
  let y = exp (neg x) in
  (F 1. - y) / (F 1. + y)
);;
```

As you see, you can just keep calling `diff` to get higher and higher-order derivatives. E.g., 

```ocaml env=algodiff_00
let f'''' f = f |> diff |> diff |> diff |> diff
```

The code above will give you the fourth derivative of `f`, i.e. `f''''`.

### Choosing Forward or Reverse Mode

Let's look at the two simple functions `f` and `g` defined below. `f` falls into the first category we mentioned before, i.e., inputs is more than outputs; whilst `g` falls into the second category.

```ocaml

  open Algodiff.D;;

  (* f : vector -> scalar *)
  let f x =
    let a = Mat.get x 0 0 in
    let b = Mat.get x 0 1 in
    let c = Mat.get x 0 2 in
    Maths.((sin a) + (cos b) + (sqr c))
  ;;

  (* g : scalar -> vector *)
  let g x =
    let a = Maths.sin x in
    let b = Maths.cos x in
    let c = Maths.sqr x in

    let y = Mat.zeros 1 3 in
    let y = Mat.set y 0 0 a in
    let y = Mat.set y 0 1 b in
    let y = Mat.set y 0 2 c in
    y
  ;;

```

According to the rule of thumb, we need to use backward mode to differentiate `f`, i.e., calculate the gradient of `f`. How to do that then? Let's look at the code snippet below.

```ocaml

  let x = Mat.uniform 1 3;;           (* generate random input *)
  let x' = make_reverse x (tag ());;  (* init the backward mode *)
  let y = f x';;                      (* forward pass to build computation graph *)
  reverse_prop (F 1.) y;;             (* backward pass to propagate error *)
  let y' = adjval x';;                (* get the gradient value of f *)

```

`make_reverse` function does two things for us: 1) wrap `x` into type `t` that Algodiff can process using type constructor `DF`; 2) generate a unique tag for the input so that input numbers can have nested structure. By calling `f x'`, we construct the computation graph of `f` and the graph structure is maintained in the returned result `y`. Finally, `reverse_prop` function propagates the error back to the inputs.

In the end, the gradient of `f` is stored in the adjacent value of `x'`, and we can retrieve that with `adjval` function.

How about function `g` then, the function represents those having a small amount of inputs but a large amount of outputs. According to the rule of thumb, we are suppose to use the forward pass to calculate the derivatives of the outputs w.r.t its inputs.

```ocaml

  let x = make_forward (F 1.) (F 1.) (tag ());;  (* seed the input *)
  let y = g x;;                                  (* forward pass *)
  let y' = tangent y;;                           (* get all derivatives *)

```

Forward mode appears much simpler than the backward mode. `make_forward` function does almost the same thing as `make_reverse` does for us, the only exception is that `make_forward` uses `DF` type constructor to wrap up the input. All the derivatives are ready whenever the forward pass is finished, and they are stored as tangent values in `y`. We can retrieve the derivatives using `tangent` function, as we used `adjval` in the backward mode.

OK, how about we abandon the rule of thumb? In other words, let's use forward mode to differentiate `f` rather than using backward mode. Please check the solution below.

```text
  Need to be fixed!

  let x0 = make_forward x (Arr Vec.(unit_basis 3 0)) (tag ());;  (* seed the first input variable *)
  let t0 = tangent (f x0);;                                      (* forward pass for the first variable *)

  let x1 = make_forward x (Arr Vec.(unit_basis 3 1)) (tag ());;  (* seed the second input variable *)
  let t1 = tangent (f x1);;                                      (* forward pass for the second variable *)

  let x2 = make_forward x (Arr Vec.(unit_basis 3 2)) (tag ());;  (* seed the third input variable *)
  let t2 = tangent (f x2);;                                      (* forward pass for the third variable *)

```

As we can see, for each input variable, we need to seed individual variable and perform one forward pass. The number of forward passes increase linearly as the number of inputs increases. However, for backward mode, no matter how many inputs there are, one backward pass can give us all the derivatives of the inputs. I guess now you understand why we need to use backward mode for `f`. One real-world example of `f` is machine learning and neural network algorithms, wherein there are many inputs but the output is often one scalar value from loss function.

Similarly, you can try to use backward mode to differentiate `g`. I will just this as an exercise for you. One last thing I want to mention is: backward mode needs to maintain a directed computation graph in the memory so that the errors can propagate back; whereas the forward mode does not have to do that due to the algebra of dual numbers.

In reality, you don't really need to worry about forward or backward mode if you simply use high-level APIs such as `diff`, `grad`, `hessian`, and etc. However, there might be cases you do need to operate these low-level functions to write up your own applications (e.g., implementing a neural network), then knowing the mechanisms behind the scene is definitely a big plus.

### Simple Jacobian and Gradient 

REFER: Automatic Differentiation in MATLAB using ADMAT with Applications


### Gradient Descent Algorithm

Gradient Descent (GD) is a popular numerical method for calculating the optimal value for a given function. Often you need to hand craft the derivative of your function `f` before plugging into gradient descendent algorithm. With `Algodiff`, derivation can be done easily. The following several lines of code define the skeleton of GD.

```ocaml env=algodiff_01
open Algodiff.D

let rec desc ?(eta=F 0.01) ?(eps=1e-6) f x =
  let g = (diff f) x in
  if (unpack_flt g) < eps then x
  else desc ~eta ~eps f Maths.(x - eta * g);;
```

Now let's define a function we want to optimise, then plug it into `desc` function.

```ocaml env=algodiff_01
let f x = Maths.(sin x + cos x);;
let x_min = desc f (F 0.1);;
```

Because we started searching from `0.`, the `desc` function successfully found the local minimum at `-2.35619175250552448`. You can visually verify that by plotting it out.

```ocaml env=algodiff_01
let g x = sin x +. cos x in
let h = Plot.create "plot_01.png" in
Plot.plot_fun ~h g (-5.) 5.;
Plot.output h;;
```

### Newton's Algorithm

Newton's method is a root-finding algorithm by successively searching for better approximation of the root. The Newton's method converges faster than gradient descent. The following implementation calculates the exact hessian of `f` which in practice is very expensive operation.

```ocaml env=algodiff_02
open Algodiff.D

let rec newton ?(eta=F 0.01) ?(eps=1e-6) f x =
  let g, h = (gradhessian f) x in
  if (Maths.l2norm' g |> unpack_flt) < eps then x
  else newton ~eta ~eps f Maths.(x - eta * g *@ (inv h));;
```

Now we can apply `newton` to find the extreme value of `Maths.(cos x |> sum')`.

```ocaml env=algodiff_02
# let f x = Maths.(cos x |> sum') in
  newton f (Mat.uniform 1 2)
- : t = [Arr(1,2)]
```

## Algorithmic Differentiation: The Engine of Neural Network

In order to understand AD, you need to practice enough, especially if you are interested in the knowing the mechanisms under the hood. I provide some small but representative examples to help you start.


### Backpropagation in Neural Network

Now let's talk about the hyped neural network. Backpropagation is the core of all neural networks, actually it is just a special case of reverse mode AD. Therefore, we can write up the backpropagation algorithm from scratch easily with the help of `Algodiff` module.

```text
let backprop nn eta x y =
  let t = tag () in
  Array.iter (fun l ->
    l.w <- make_reverse l.w t;
    l.b <- make_reverse l.b t;
  ) nn.layers;
  let loss = Maths.(cross_entropy y (run_network x nn) / (F (Mat.row_num y |> float_of_int))) in
  reverse_prop (F 1.) loss;
  Array.iter (fun l ->
    l.w <- Maths.((primal l.w) - (eta * (adjval l.w))) |> primal;
    l.b <- Maths.((primal l.b) - (eta * (adjval l.b))) |> primal;
  ) nn.layers;
  loss |> unpack_flt
```

Yes, we just used only 13 lines of code to implement the backpropagation. Actually, with some extra coding, we can make a smart application to recognise handwritten digits. E.g., running the application will give you the following prediction on handwritten digit `6`. The code has been included in Owl's example and you can find the complete example in [backprop.ml](https://github.com/owlbarb/owl/blob/master/examples/backprop.ml).

### Example: Computation Graph of Simple Functions

Backward mode generates and maintains a computation graph in order to back propagate the error. The computation graph is very helpful in both debugging and understanding the characteristic of your numerical functions. Owl provides two functions to facilitate you in generating computation graphs.

```text
  val to_trace: t list -> string
  (* print out the trace in human-readable format *)

  val to_dot : tlist -> string
  (* print out the computation graph in dot format *)
```

`to_trace` is useful when the graph is small and you can print it out on the terminal then observe it directly. `to_dot` is more useful when the graph grows bigger since you can use specialised visualisation tools to generate professional figures, such as Graphviz.

In the following, I will showcase several computation graphs. However, I will skip the details of how to generate these graphs since you can find out in the [computation_graph.ml](https://github.com/ryanrhymes/owl/blob/master/examples/computation_graph.ml).

Let's start with a simple function as below.

```ocaml env=algodiff_00
let f x y = Maths.((x * sin (x + x) + ( F 1. * sqrt x) / F 7.) * (relu y) |> sum)
```

The generated computation graph looks like this.

### Example: Computation Graph of VGG-like Neural Network

Let's define a VGG-like neural network as below.

```ocaml
open Neural.S
open Neural.S.Graph

let make_network input_shape =
  input input_shape
  |> normalisation ~decay:0.9
  |> conv2d [|3;3;3;32|] [|1;1|] ~act_typ:Activation.Relu
  |> conv2d [|3;3;32;32|] [|1;1|] ~act_typ:Activation.Relu ~padding:VALID
  |> max_pool2d [|2;2|] [|2;2|] ~padding:VALID
  |> dropout 0.1
  |> conv2d [|3;3;32;64|] [|1;1|] ~act_typ:Activation.Relu
  |> conv2d [|3;3;64;64|] [|1;1|] ~act_typ:Activation.Relu ~padding:VALID
  |> max_pool2d [|2;2|] [|2;2|] ~padding:VALID
  |> dropout 0.1
  |> fully_connected 512 ~act_typ:Activation.Relu
  |> linear 10 ~act_typ:Activation.(Softmax 1)
  |> get_network
```

The computation graph for this neural network become a bit more complicated now.

![Computation graph of the VGG neural network](images/algodiff/plot_029.png "plot 029"){ width=100%, #fig:algodiff:plot29 }


### Example: Computation Graph of LSTM Network

How about LSTM network? The following definition seems much lighter than convolutional neural network in the previous example.

```ocaml
open Neural.S
open Neural.S.Graph

let make_network wndsz vocabsz =
  input [|wndsz|]
  |> embedding vocabsz 40
  |> lstm 128
  |> linear 512 ~act_typ:Activation.Relu
  |> linear vocabsz ~act_typ:Activation.(Softmax 1)
  |> get_network
```

However, the generated computation graph is way more complicated due to LSTM's internal recurrent structure. You can download the [PDF file 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ryanrhymes/owl/image/plot_030.pdf) for better image quality.

### Example: Computation Graph of Google's Inception

If the computation graph above hasn't scared you yet, here is another one generated from Google's Inception network for image classification. I will not paste the code here since the definition of the network per se is already quite complicated. You can use Owl's zoo system `#zoo "6dfed11c521fb2cd286f2519fb88d3bf"`.

The image below is too small to check details, please download the [PDF file 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ryanrhymes/owl/image/plot_031.pdf).
